    <h1>⚖️ Terms of Use</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">The rules. The boundaries.</p>
    <p class="last-updated">Effective Date: December 12, 2025</p>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: December 12, 2025</p>

    <div class="highlight">
      <p>🎯 TL;DR: Use The Impulse Judge for good (saving money). Don't use it for evil. We're here to help you keep your money, not take it.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="warning">
      <p><strong>Not Legal Advice:</strong> These Terms are a legal contract, but nothing here constitutes legal advice. If you need legal counsel, consult a licensed attorney in your jurisdiction.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>1. Agreement to Terms</h2>
    <p>By installing The Impulse Judge browser extension, visiting our website, or subscribing to our newsletter, you agree to these Terms of Use. If you disagree with any part, please don't use our services.</p>
    
    <h3>Changes to Terms</h3>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. <strong>Changes required by law, security reasons, or to prevent abuse become effective immediately upon posting.</strong> All other material changes will become effective 30 days after posting the updated Terms with a new 'Last updated' date. Continued use after the effective date constitutes acceptance of the modified Terms.</p>

    <p><strong>For material changes</strong> (e.g., new fees, dispute resolution changes, significant policy shifts), we will provide additional notice via:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Extension update notification</li>
        <li>Email to newsletter subscribers</li>
        <li>Banner on theimpulsejudge.com</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Right to Reject:</strong> If you disagree with material changes, you may terminate your use of the Services prior to the effective date, and the previous Terms will govern any disputes arising before termination.</p>

    <h2>2. What We Provide</h2>
    <p>The Impulse Judge offers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Browser Extension:</strong> A free tool that detects cart/checkout buttons and encourages you to think twice before purchasing</li>
      <li><strong>Website:</strong> Information about our extension, blog content about mindful spending, and resources</li>
      <li><strong>Newsletter:</strong> Optional email updates with tips, humor, and (gasp) maybe someday deals that actually save you money</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do NOT provide financial advice. We provide comedic intervention designed to help you pause before purchases.</p>
    <p><strong>Website Analytics:</strong> We use Vercel Analytics on theimpulsejudge.com to understand how people use our website (not the extension). This is cookieless, privacy-friendly analytics that helps us improve the site. For full details, see our <a href="/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
    
    <h3>Service Modifications & Discontinuation</h3>
    <p>We reserve the right to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Modify or discontinue</strong> any feature, functionality, or the entire Service at any time without prior notice</li>
      <li><strong>Impose limits</strong> on certain features or restrict access to parts of the Service</li>
      <li><strong>Temporarily suspend</strong> the Service for maintenance, updates, or technical issues</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We will not be liable to you or any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Service. As a free service, you acknowledge that we provide this on a best-effort basis with no guarantee of perpetual availability.</p>
    
    <h3>Future Cloud Features</h3>
    <p>Currently, The Impulse Judge extension operates entirely locally with no data transmission or cloud storage. If we ever introduce features that require remote processing, we commit to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Opt-In Only:</strong> Any feature that transmits data will be explicitly opt-in and clearly labeled</li>
      <li><strong>Privacy Policy Update:</strong> We will update this Privacy Policy and notify users before such features launch</li>
      <li><strong>No Silent Changes:</strong> We will NOT quietly add tracking or data collection to existing features. Local-first features will remain local-first</li>
      <li><strong>User Control:</strong> You will always have the option to use the extension without cloud</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This commitment protects our trust relationship with users and prevents "silent change" allegations if we expand functionality in the future.</p>
    
    <h3>Platform & App Store Policies</h3>
    <p>The Impulse Judge extension is distributed through third-party platforms (Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons, etc.). These platforms have their own policies and terms that govern extension availability and distribution.</p>
    <p><strong>Important:</strong> We are not responsible if a platform removes, restricts, suspends, or refuses to host the extension for any reason, including policy changes, content moderation decisions, or platform discretion. Extension availability is subject to app store policies and platform decisions that are outside our control. We may be required to modify or remove features to comply with platform policies without prior notice to users.</p>
    <p>If the extension is removed from a platform, we will make reasonable efforts to communicate via our website and newsletter, but we have no obligation to provide alternative distribution channels or refunds (as the service is free).</p>
    
    <h3>Official Distribution & Third-Party Repacks</h3>
    <p><strong>Only install The Impulse Judge from official sources listed on <a href="https://theimpulsejudge.com">theimpulsejudge.com</a>.</strong> Official distribution channels include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Chrome Web Store (when approved)</li>
      <li>Firefox Add-ons (when approved)</li>
      <li>GitHub Releases (for developer installation)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We are NOT responsible for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Modified versions of the extension distributed through unofficial channels</li>
      <li>Third-party "repacks" or re-uploads to private catalogs or alternative stores</li>
      <li>Malware, tracking, or modifications added by third parties</li>
      <li>Functionality or security issues in unofficial versions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you encounter The Impulse Judge on a platform or website not listed on our official site, it may be unauthorized and potentially malicious. Report it to support@theimpulsejudge.com.</p>
    
    <h3>Region-Specific Restrictions</h3>
    <p>Chrome, Firefox, and other platforms may impose region-specific restrictions or requirements on extensions, particularly around content related to mental health, financial advice, or "self-help" tools. We may be required to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Geo-restrict the extension in certain countries or regions</li>
      <li>Modify features, roasts, or messaging to comply with local content regulations</li>
      <li>Add region-specific disclaimers or warnings</li>
      <li>Remove the extension entirely from certain markets if platform policies require it</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We are not responsible if the extension is unavailable or has reduced functionality in your region due to platform or regulatory requirements. Availability and features are subject to change based on evolving store policies and local laws.</p>

    <h2>3. Your Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>By using The Impulse Judge, you agree to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the extension for personal, non-commercial purposes</li>
      <li>Not attempt to reverse engineer, modify, or distribute the extension (it's open source though, so... just fork it properly)</li>
      <li>Not use our services for anything illegal or harmful</li>
      <li>Take responsibility for your own financial decisions (we can only judge, not decide for you)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Acceptable Use Policy</h3>
    <p>In addition to the responsibilities above, you agree NOT to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Automated/Commercial Use:</strong> Use the extension in automated systems, bots, scrapers, or commercial data collection operations</li>
      <li><strong>Reverse Engineering (Beyond Open Source):</strong> While the code is open source, you may not reverse engineer the extension for malicious purposes, to create confusingly similar products, or to circumvent store policies</li>
      <li><strong>Interference:</strong> Use the extension to disrupt, interfere with, or harm third-party websites beyond its normal intended function (blocking checkout buttons for personal use)</li>
      <li><strong>Resale/Redistribution:</strong> Sell, rent, lease, or redistribute the extension (or modified versions) under our name or confusingly similar branding</li>
      <li><strong>Security Testing Without Permission:</strong> Conduct security testing, penetration testing, or vulnerability research without following our responsible disclosure policy (see CONTRIBUTING.md)</li>
      <li><strong>Impersonation:</strong> Impersonate The Impulse Judge Project, our team, or other users</li>
      <li><strong>Abuse:</strong> Use the extension to harass, stalk, or harm others, or to violate any applicable laws</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Violation of this Acceptable Use Policy may result in termination of your access to our services and potential legal action.</p>
    
    <h3>User Responsibility for Content Sharing</h3>
    <p>The Impulse Judge generates roasts, messages, and satirical content that appears on your screen. You are responsible for how you use, share, or distribute this content:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Screenshots & Social Sharing:</strong> If you screenshot roasts and share them on social media, in messages, or in other contexts, you are responsible for ensuring your use complies with applicable laws and platform policies</li>
      <li><strong>Harassment & Bullying:</strong> DO NOT use screenshots, quotes, or content from The Impulse Judge to harass, bully, shame, or attack other individuals. This project judges <em>purchases</em>, not <em>people</em>. Using our content to target individuals violates our values and may violate harassment laws</li>
      <li><strong>Context Matters:</strong> Roasts generated for your personal use are satirical self-reflection tools. Sharing them out of context to mock others is misuse of the extension</li>
      <li><strong>No Liability:</strong> We are not responsible for user-to-user harassment, conflicts, or legal disputes arising from how you share or use content generated by the extension</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>If you see someone misusing Impulse Judge content to harass others, report it to the relevant platform (not to us, as we have no control over user behavior outside the extension).</strong></p>
    
    <h3>High-Risk Users & Vulnerable Populations</h3>
    <p>The Impulse Judge uses humor and "tough love" messaging that may not be appropriate for everyone. If you have a genuine compulsive buying disorder, shopping addiction, anxiety, depression, or other mental health condition that could be triggered or worsened by judgmental humor:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Seek Professional Help:</strong> The extension is not a substitute for clinical treatment. Please consult a licensed mental health professional</li>
      <li><strong>Use Caution:</strong> Consider whether the extension's tone is helpful or harmful for your specific situation</li>
      <li><strong>Feedback Welcome:</strong> If you believe certain roasts or features are unhelpful or potentially harmful for vulnerable users, email support@theimpulsejudge.com with constructive feedback. We may update content based on user input, but we cannot monitor or moderate individual use cases</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify roasts, add content warnings, or implement sensitivity filters based on community feedback, but we make no guarantees about the appropriateness of humor for individual circumstances.</p>
    
    <h3>User Input on Website Games</h3>
    <p>Our website includes interactive "Free Therapy" mini-games where you may type text (e.g., The Void, Pet The Rock). You are responsible for any content you input:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Do NOT input copyrighted material, brand names, slogans, or content you don't have rights to use</li>
      <li>Do NOT input illegal, threatening, harassing, or abusive content</li>
      <li>We do not store or transmit your inputs (they remain in your browser), but you are responsible for what you type</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This reinforces our DMCA safe harbor position: we provide the tools, you provide the content, and you bear responsibility for that content.</p>
    
    <h3>Optional Donations (Buy Me a Coffee)</h3>
    <p>The Impulse Judge extension and website are <strong>100% free</strong> with zero hidden costs, subscriptions, or paywalls. We include optional donation links ("Buy Me a Coffee") in the extension popup and website footer as a way for users to support development if they choose.</p>
    <p><strong>Important clarifications:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Donations are completely voluntary and optional</li>
      <li>Donating does NOT unlock features, remove ads (there are none), or provide any preferential treatment</li>
      <li>The extension functions identically whether you donate $0 or $1,000</li>
      <li>We do not sell, license, or exchange any digital goods, services, or features for donations</li>
      <li>This is not "in-app purchasing" as defined by Chrome Web Store or Firefox Add-ons policies</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Think of it like street performing: The show is free, but if it saved you money, you can throw a coin in the hat. Or don't. The Judge will judge you either way. 😏</p>

    <h2>4. Intellectual Property</h2>
    
    <h3>Trademark (U.S. & Canada)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Impulse Judge™</strong> is a common law trademark of The Impulse Judge Project, first used in commerce on <strong>December 12, 2025</strong>. This establishes our rights under U.S. and Canadian trademark law through continuous use in commerce.</p>
    
    <h3>Copyright (Global Protection)</h3>
    <p>The Impulse Judge character, persona, "roast" database, and all original creative works are protected globally under the <strong>Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works</strong> (181 member countries). Our public GitHub repository serves as timestamped proof of creation and ownership.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Emoji & Icon Disclaimer:</strong> We do not claim trademark or copyright ownership over standard Unicode emojis or third-party icon assets (such as Microsoft Fluent UI, Apple, Google, or other vendor emoji artwork). Our current app icon is based on standard emoji artwork and is NOT claimed as a proprietary trademark. We use emoji artwork under the applicable vendor licenses (e.g., Microsoft Fluent UI emojis are MIT-licensed, permitting commercial use including affiliate activities). The emojis used throughout our extension, website, and games are standard Unicode characters owned by their respective vendors. Only our original creative works (name, character, roasts, game names, written content) are claimed as intellectual property.</p>
    
    <p>The extension code is open source under the MIT License. However, the creative content (roasts, character, branding) is proprietary and may NOT be reproduced without permission.</p>
    <p>You may share our content with attribution. You may not claim our Judge character as your own (he has been through enough already).</p>
    
    <h3>Website Games, Tools & Creative Works</h3>
    <p>Our website includes interactive mini-games (Dopamine Dash, Credit Defense, Judge The Hype, Mystery Box of Disappointment, The Void, Pet The Rock, etc.), financial calculators (Time Cost, Yearly Savings, Investment FOMO, Inflation Reality), and the Sobriety Certificate generator. These are <strong>proprietary creative works</strong>, not MIT-licensed code.</p>
    
    <p><strong>What We Protect (Original Creative Expression):</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Specific game names and branding (e.g., "Dopamine Dash," "Credit Defense," "Judge The Hype," "Mystery Box of Disappointment," "The Impulse Judge")</li>
      <li>Original artwork, visual designs, and graphical elements we created</li>
      <li>Specific written text, humor, dialogue, and copy within games and calculators</li>
      <li>The particular visual presentation and artistic styling of our tools</li>
      <li>Sobriety Certificate templates: specific designs, layouts, and humorous text we wrote</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>What We Do NOT Claim (Uncopyrightable Under Law):</strong></p>
    <p><em>Consistent with established copyright law including Baker v. Selden (1879), Feist v. Rural (1991), and Lotus v. Borland (1996), we make no intellectual property claim to:</em></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Our current app icon/logo (based on third-party emoji artwork, used under MIT license)</li>
      <li>Standard Unicode emojis used throughout the extension and website</li>
      <li>Game mechanics, rules, or gameplay concepts (endless runners, clickers, bubble wrap simulators)</li>
      <li>Mathematical formulas, algorithms, or calculation methods used in our calculators</li>
      <li>Generic concepts or ideas ("impulse control tools," "spending trackers," "sobriety certificates")</li>
      <li>Functional UI elements and common interaction patterns</li>
      <li>Standard coding patterns, algorithms, or technical implementations</li>
      <li>Facts, data, or information displayed through our tools</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Plain English:</strong> You're welcome to build your own impulse-control games, tower defense games, swipe-judgment games, savings calculators, or sobriety certificate generators—those concepts aren't ours to own. What you cannot do is copy our specific creative work: our exact text, our particular visual designs, our game names ("Dopamine Dash," "Credit Defense," "Judge The Hype," "Mystery Box of Disappointment"), our specific characters and humor, or our branding. Create your own original content and you're in the clear.</p>
    
    <h3>IP Registration & Enforcement Strategy</h3>
    <p><strong>Current Status:</strong> We rely on common law trademark rights (U.S./Canada) and Berne Convention copyright (automatic global protection). We have not yet filed for registered trademark or copyright registration.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Registration Roadmap:</strong> As the Project grows, we may pursue formal trademark and/or copyright registrations in relevant jurisdictions.</p>
        
    <h3>User-Generated Content & DMCA Safe Harbor</h3>
    <p>We welcome community contributions via GitHub, but we are not responsible for content posted by users. Under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. § 512), we respond to valid DMCA takedown notices.</p>
    <p><strong>DMCA Agent:</strong> support@theimpulsejudge.com</p>
    <p>If you believe user-contributed content infringes your copyright, please send a proper DMCA notice. False claims may result in liability under 17 U.S.C. § 512(f).</p>
    
    <h3>DMCA Counter-Notice Procedure</h3>
    <p>If you believe content you posted was wrongly removed due to a DMCA takedown, you may send a counter-notice to support@theimpulsejudge.com containing:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your physical or electronic signature</li>
      <li>Identification of the removed content and its prior location</li>
      <li>A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief the content was removed by mistake or misidentification</li>
      <li>Your name, address, phone number, and consent to jurisdiction of Ontario courts</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We will forward valid counter-notices to the original complainant. If they do not file a court action within 10-14 business days, we may restore the content.</p>
    
    <h3>Social Media Handles & Community Impersonation</h3>
    <p><strong>Official Accounts:</strong> Only social media accounts, community spaces, and online handles explicitly listed on theimpulsejudge.com are official representations of The Impulse Judge Project. We do not authorize the use of "Impulse Judge," "The Impulse Judge," or confusingly similar variations in usernames, handles, or community names without our express written consent.</p>
    <p><strong>Reporting Impersonation:</strong> If you encounter accounts impersonating The Impulse Judge on social media, app stores, or other platforms, please report them to support@theimpulsejudge.com. We will pursue takedown requests and trademark violation reports with the relevant platforms.</p>
    <p><strong>Fan/Community Accounts:</strong> If you wish to create a fan account or community space, you must clearly indicate it is unofficial (e.g., "Unofficial Fan Community" or "Inspired by The Impulse Judge") and may not use our exact branding or claim affiliation without permission.</p>
    
    <div class="warning">
      <p><strong>We actively enforce our IP rights.</strong> Unauthorized reproduction or derivative use of our creative works is prohibited globally and may result in DMCA takedowns, trademark claims, and removal from app stores.</p>
    </div>

    <p>The Impulse Judge is a <strong>satirical work</strong> designed to provide humorous commentary on consumer behavior and shopping culture. All content, including roasts, jokes, and retailer references, is intended as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Parody:</strong> Exaggerated imitation for comedic and educational purposes</li>
      <li><strong>Satire:</strong> Social commentary critiquing impulse buying and consumer culture</li>
      <li><strong>Fair Use:</strong> Transformative commentary on retail practices</li>
      <li><strong>Opinion:</strong> Subjective humor, not statements of fact</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Retailer References & Disclaimers</h3>
    <p>When The Impulse Judge mentions specific retailers, brands, or products, please understand:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Not Affiliated:</strong> We are not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by any retailer mentioned</li>
      <li><strong>Nominative Fair Use:</strong> Use of retailer names is "nominative fair use" under trademark law — necessary to identify what we're commenting on, without implying endorsement or affiliation</li>
      <li><strong>Transformative Use:</strong> Our use is transformative: we add new meaning by critiquing consumer psychology and shopping behavior, not substituting for or competing with the original retailers</li>
      <li><strong>Parody/Commentary:</strong> Any retailer names, logos, or references are used for satirical commentary under fair use principles</li>
      <li><strong>Not Defamatory:</strong> Our jokes are humorous exaggerations about shopping behavior, not factual claims about businesses</li>
      <li><strong>Educational Purpose:</strong> We critique consumer psychology and shopping triggers, not the quality of retailers' products or services</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Protected Speech (First Amendment / Charter Rights)</h3>
    <p>The Impulse Judge's content is protected under:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>U.S. First Amendment:</strong> Parody and satirical commentary are constitutionally protected speech</li>
      <li><strong>Canadian Charter of Rights:</strong> Freedom of expression includes satirical and comedic works</li>
      <li><strong>Fair Use Doctrine:</strong> Our use of retailer names/references is transformative, non-commercial (the extension is free), and does not substitute for the retailers' services</li>
      <li><strong>Anti-SLAPP Protection:</strong> This is commentary on matters of public interest (consumer behavior), protected under anti-SLAPP statutes designed to prevent frivolous lawsuits that chill free speech</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What We Are NOT Doing</h3>
    <div class="warning">
      <p>To be absolutely clear:</p>
    </div>
    <ul>
      <li>❌ We are NOT claiming any affiliation with retailers we mention</li>
      <li>❌ We are NOT making factual statements about business practices (our jokes are humor, not journalism)</li>
      <li>❌ We are NOT discouraging people from shopping at specific stores (shop wherever you want, just think first)</li>
      <li>❌ We are NOT infringing trademarks (mentioning a brand name for commentary is not infringement)</li>
      <li>❌ We are NOT competing with retailers (we don't sell products, we sell self-control)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Examples of Satirical Use</h3>
    <p><strong>Acceptable (What We Might Do):</strong></p>
    <ul class="always-list">
      <li>✅ "Buying your 47th Amazon package this month? The Judge is impressed by your commitment to cardboard hoarding."</li>
      <li>✅ "Shein haul incoming? Your closet called. It's full. It's been full since 2019."</li>
      <li>✅ "Target run for 'one thing'? We both know how this ends. $147 and a cart full of regret."</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Not Acceptable (What We Don't Do):</strong></p>
    <ul class="never-list">
      <li>❌ "[Retailer] sells counterfeit products" (factual claim, defamatory)</li>
      <li>❌ "[Retailer] steals customer data" (factual claim, defamatory)</li>
      <li>❌ "Don't shop at [Retailer], they're a scam" (not satire, direct harm to business)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Reasonable Person Standard</h3>
    <p>Our content is clearly presented as humor and satire. A reasonable person would understand that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The "Judge" is a fictional character, not a real legal authority</li>
      <li>The roasts are comedic exaggerations, not literal accusations</li>
      <li>The extension's purpose is self-reflection, not retailer criticism</li>
      <li>Our tone is playful sarcasm, not malicious defamation</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Trademark Fair Use</h3>
    <p>When we mention retailer names, we are exercising <strong>nominative fair use</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>We only use the name to the extent necessary to identify the retailer in our commentary</li>
      <li>We do not suggest sponsorship or endorsement</li>
      <li>We do not use their logos or trade dress in a way that causes confusion</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Mentioning "Amazon" or "Target" in a joke is not trademark infringement - it's necessary to make the joke understandable.</p>

    <h3>Our Commitment</h3>
    <p>The Impulse Judge will always:</p>
    <ul class="always-list">
      <li>✅ Clearly present content as satire and humor</li>
      <li>✅ Avoid making false factual claims about businesses</li>
      <li>✅ Focus humor on consumer behavior, not attacking retailers</li>
      <li>✅ Use retailer references only for identification and commentary</li>
      <li>✅ Remove content if it crosses the line from satire to defamation</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Retailer Complaints & Content Moderation</h3>
    <p>If a retailer raises a good-faith concern that specific roasts, references, or content may violate platform policies, trademark law, or defamation standards, we will:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Review in Good Faith:</strong> Evaluate the complaint objectively and consider whether the content is protected satire or potentially problematic</li>
      <li><strong>Discretionary Removal:</strong> We may remove, modify, or adjust specific roasts at our discretion to address legitimate concerns</li>
      <li><strong>No Admission of Liability:</strong> Choosing to remove content does NOT constitute an admission that the original content was unlawful or infringing</li>
      <li><strong>Platform Cooperation:</strong> We will cooperate with Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons, and other platforms to resolve content disputes reasonably</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This helps demonstrate to platforms that we are responsible, good-faith actors if there's ever a retailer complaint, while preserving our satire and fair use defenses.</p>

You may revoke this license by contacting us at support@theimpulsejudge.com, and we will remove your testimonial within 30 days.</p>
    <p><strong>No Compensation:</strong> Testimonials are provided voluntarily. We do not provide compensation, payment, or consideration in exchange for testimonials unless explicitly agreed in writing (e.g., affiliate partnerships, which would be disclosed per Section 8).</p>

    <h2>7. Newsletter Terms</h2>
    <p>By subscribing to our newsletter, you agree to receive:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Tips on resisting impulse purchases</li>

      <li>Potentially, curated deals or recommendations that align with our mission</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can unsubscribe anytime with one click. We won't guilt trip you. Okay, maybe The Judge will silently judge, but that's it.</p>

    <h2 id="affiliate-disclosure">8. Affiliate Disclosure & Our Sacred Oath</h2>
    <p>Here's where we get serious. Really serious.</p>
    
    <div class="oath-box">
      <h3>🤚 The Impulse Judge Affiliate Pledge</h3>
      <p>We pledge that if we include affiliate links or sponsored recommendations, we will use <strong>commercially reasonable efforts</strong> to:</p>
      <ul class="always-list">
        <li><strong>Select reputable companies</strong> that we believe help you save money</li>
        <li><strong>Review and vet partners</strong> to the best of our ability before recommending them</li>
        <li><strong>Clearly disclose</strong> when a link is an affiliate link</li>
        <li><strong>Prioritize your wallet</strong> over ours</li>
      </ul>
      <p style="font-size: 0.9em; margin-top: 16px; border-top: 1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.2); padding-top: 8px;">
        <em><strong>Legal Reality Check:</strong> While we promise to do our homework, we cannot control third parties. We are not liable if a partner changes their practices, fails to deliver, or turns out to be "evil" despite our vetting.</em>
      </p>
    </div>

<h3>🚫 Excluded Categories (The "Hard Pass" List)</h3>
    <p>To maintain your trust, we maintain a strict policy against accepting sponsorships or affiliate partnerships where the <strong>primary business model</strong> involves:</p>
    
    <ul class="excluded-list">
      <li>❌ <strong>Cryptocurrency Scams or NFT schemes</strong> - The Judge didn't survive 2019 to watch you lose money on digital monkey pictures.</li>
      <li>❌ <strong>Online casinos or gambling</strong> - That's not impulse buying, that's a different problem entirely.</li>
      <li>❌ <strong>"Buy Now, Pay Later" services</strong> - These are impulse enablers wearing a trench coat. Hard pass.</li>
      <li>❌ <strong>Get-rich-quick schemes</strong> - If it sounds too good to be true, The Judge is already side-eyeing it.</li>
      <li>❌ <strong>Predatory lending</strong> - We're here to save your money, not help others take it.</li>
      <li>❌ <strong>Multi-Level Marketing (MLMs)</strong> - No, Karen, we don't want to join your "opportunity."</li>
      <li>❌ <strong>Anything that contradicts our core mission</strong> - Helping you spend less and save more.</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="font-size: 0.9em; margin-top: 10px;"><em><strong>Note:</strong> We reserve the right to determine, at our sole discretion, whether a potential partner falls into these categories.</em></p>

    <h3>What We MIGHT Affiliate With (If We Ever Do):</h3>
    <ul class="always-list">
      <li>✅ Budgeting apps and tools that actually work</li>
      <li>✅ Legitimate cashback or savings services</li>
      <li>✅ Financial education resources</li>
      <li>✅ Quality products that prevent unnecessary purchases</li>
      <li>✅ Services that help you cancel subscriptions you forgot about</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>The bottom line:</strong> Our mission is to help you KEEP your money. If we ever recommend something, it's because we genuinely believe it serves that mission. The moment we prioritize profit over your financial wellbeing, The Judge officially becomes the villain - and that's not the character arc we want.</p>

    <h2>9. Disclaimers</h2>
    
    <h3>Not Financial, Medical, or Therapeutic Advice</h3>
    <p>The Impulse Judge is a humor-based entertainment tool for self-reflection. We are NOT:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Financial advisors, accountants, or investment professionals</li>
      <li>Licensed therapists, counselors, or mental health professionals</li>
      <li>Medical professionals treating shopping addiction, ADHD, or any disorder</li>
      <li>A substitute for professional help if you have a genuine shopping addiction</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Important:</strong> References to "therapy," "addiction," or "help" are colloquial humor, not clinical services. If you believe you have a genuine shopping addiction, compulsive buying disorder, or any mental health condition, please seek help from a licensed mental health professional.</p>
    <p>The "roasts" and messages delivered by The Impulse Judge are written by humans for entertainment and satirical purposes. The "Judge" is a fictional character designed to be hyperbolic, stern, and judgmental. These messages are jokes, not personal attacks. By using the extension, you agree to be "roasted" and understand that these comments are not to be taken literally or seriously.</p>
    
    <h3>"As Is" Service - No Warranties</h3>
    <p><strong>THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NONINFRINGEMENT.</strong></p>
    <p>The extension and website are provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. We do our best to keep things running smoothly, but we can't guarantee the extension will work on every website or catch every checkout button. Some sites are sneaky. We make no warranties that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The extension will be error-free or uninterrupted</li>
      <li>Defects will be corrected</li>
      <li>The extension is free from viruses or harmful components</li>
      <li>Results obtained will be accurate or reliable</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Third-Party Sites</h3>
    <p>We're not responsible for third-party websites you visit, even if you got there through our extension or links. Once you leave our little corner of the internet, you're on your own (but The Judge's voice might still echo in your head).</p>
    
    <h3>Professional Use Disclaimer</h3>
    <p>If you are a financial advisor, therapist, coach, counselor, or other professional using The Impulse Judge as a tool with your clients:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>We do NOT enter into any professional relationship with your clients</li>
      <li>You remain solely responsible for your professional services and compliance with your licensing, ethical, and legal obligations</li>
      <li>The extension is a consumer tool, not a clinical or professional instrument</li>
      <li>We are not responsible for how you integrate the tool into your practice or any outcomes from your professional services</li>
      <li>You must obtain any required client consent for using third-party tools in your practice</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Use of The Impulse Judge in a professional context does not create any advisor-client relationship between The Impulse Judge Project and your clients, nor does it create any liability on our part for your professional conduct.</p>
    
    <h3>Critical Use & Productivity Disclaimer</h3>
    <p><strong>The Impulse Judge is NOT intended for use in situations where purchase decisions are critical to job duties, safety, business operations, or time-sensitive workflows.</strong></p>
    <p>Examples of inappropriate use contexts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Emergency Purchases:</strong> Medical supplies, safety equipment, urgent business tools</li>
      <li><strong>Professional Procurement:</strong> Making purchases on behalf of your employer or clients as part of job responsibilities</li>
      <li><strong>Time-Critical Work:</strong> Situations where the extension's delay could cause missed deadlines, lost opportunities, or workflow disruptions</li>
      <li><strong>Accessibility Tools:</strong> Purchasing assistive technology or accommodations where delay could cause harm</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>User Responsibility:</strong> If you use the extension in contexts where it slows or blocks necessary purchases, you agree to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Disable the extension immediately for critical-use sites (use the "Never Sites" feature)</li>
      <li>Not hold us liable for productivity losses, employment disputes, or missed opportunities</li>
      <li>Recognize that the extension is designed for discretionary personal shopping, not professional or critical purchases</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Employers: If an employee claims harm from using this extension during work, that is an employment matter between you and the employee. We provide tools for personal impulse control, not workplace productivity management.</p>
    
    <h3>Workplace Accommodations & Accessibility</h3>
    <p>If you are an employer considering this extension as part of a workplace wellness program:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The extension is NOT a substitute for employer policies, financial wellness training, or required workplace accommodations</li>
      <li>DO NOT use the extension as a disciplinary tool or to monitor/control employee spending</li>
      <li>Ensure any deployment complies with disability accommodation laws, workplace privacy regulations, and employee consent requirements</li>
      <li>We are not responsible for employment law compliance, workplace disputes, or accommodation failures related to extension deployment</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Enterprise & Workplace Deployment</h3>
    <p>If you are an organization deploying The Impulse Judge to employees or members (e.g., workplace wellness programs, corporate browser extension deployments):</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Your Responsibility:</strong> You are responsible for ensuring compliance with employment law, workplace privacy regulations, monitoring/surveillance laws, and obtaining any required employee consent</li>
      <li><strong>No Employer-Employee Relationship:</strong> We are not your vendor, contractor, or business associate for purposes of employment law, HIPAA, or other regulatory frameworks</li>
      <li><strong>Data Protection:</strong> Since the extension stores data locally, you must inform employees that their usage statistics remain on their devices and ensure your deployment complies with workplace data protection laws</li>
      <li><strong>Liability:</strong> We are not responsible for how your organization uses the tool, any employment disputes arising from its deployment, or compliance with workplace regulations</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Organizations deploying the extension at scale should review the open-source code and consult their own legal counsel to ensure compliance with applicable workplace laws.</p>

    <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, The Impulse Judge and its creators shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages resulting from your use of our services.</p>
    
    <h3>Aggregate Liability Cap</h3>
    <p><strong>IN NO EVENT SHALL OUR TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL CLAIMS EXCEED THE GREATER OF (A) $100 CAD OR (B) THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US IN THE 12 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE CLAIM (WHICH IS $0 FOR FREE USERS).</strong></p>
    <p>This cap applies to all theories of liability (contract, tort, negligence, etc.) but does NOT apply where prohibited by law (e.g., liability for death, personal injury, fraud, or gross negligence/willful misconduct where such exclusions are not permitted).</p>
    
    <p>Translation: If you ignore The Judge and buy that third air fryer anyway, that's on you.</p>
    <p><strong>Specific Interaction Disclaimer:</strong> The Impulse Judge works by modifying the visual appearance of third-party websites. We do not control those websites. If a third-party site updates their code and our extension causes a button to disappear or stop working, a layout to break, or a transaction to fail, we are not responsible. You agree that you can simply disable the extension at any time to resolve such issues.</p>
    
    <h3>Savings Estimates & Calculator Disclaimers</h3>
    <p>The Impulse Judge includes features that estimate "money saved" (in the extension) and calculators that project financial impact (on the website, e.g., Time Cost, Yearly Savings, Investment FOMO). <strong>These are illustrative, approximate tools - NOT financial projections or guarantees.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Important Clarifications:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Not Financial Advice:</strong> Savings estimates and calculator results are educational illustrations, not professional financial recommendations or forecasts</li>
      <li><strong>Approximations Only:</strong> Calculations use simple math and user inputs. They do NOT account for taxes, inflation, investment risks, opportunity costs, or individual financial circumstances</li>
      <li><strong>No Reliance:</strong> Do not make significant financial decisions based solely on our calculators or savings tracker. Consult a licensed financial advisor for serious financial planning</li>
      <li><strong>No Misrepresentation:</strong> We do not claim our estimates are precise, certified, or suitable for financial reporting purposes</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Liability:</strong> We are not responsible if you relied on our savings estimates or calculator results for financial decisions that didn't work out. These tools are for motivation and self-reflection, not fiduciary-grade financial analysis.</p>
    
    <h3>Consumer Protection & Regional Rights</h3>
    
    <h4>Universal Savings Clause</h4>
    <p><strong>Nothing in these Terms excludes or limits liability that cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law.</strong> If you are a consumer in ANY jurisdiction with mandatory consumer protection rights, nothing in these Terms affects those statutory rights. Where consumer protection laws apply, our disclaimers and limitations apply only to the maximum extent permitted by such laws.</p>
    
    <div class="highlight">
      <p><strong>Important Context for All Consumers:</strong></p>
    </div>
    <ul>
      <li>The Impulse Judge is provided <strong>100% free of charge</strong> with no paid features, subscriptions, in-app purchases, or hidden costs</li>
      <li>The extension operates <strong>entirely locally</strong> on your device with <strong>no data transmission</strong> to our servers</li>
      <li>We are based in <strong>Ontario, Canada</strong> and do not actively target or market to any specific foreign jurisdiction</li>
      <li>If you have statutory consumer rights in your jurisdiction that cannot be waived by contract, <strong>those rights are fully preserved</strong></li>
      <li>Any term in these Terms found to be unfair or unenforceable under your local consumer protection law is <strong>not binding on you</strong></li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Canadian Consumers (Our Home Jurisdiction)</h4>
    <p>If you are a consumer in Canada, you are protected by federal and provincial consumer protection laws:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ontario (Consumer Protection Act, 2002):</strong> Unfair contract terms may be unenforceable. You have rights regarding unfair business practices, misrepresentation, and unconscionable transactions.</li>
      <li><strong>Quebec (Consumer Protection Act, R.S.Q., c. P-40.1):</strong> Additional protections apply including mandatory warranty provisions. Quebec consumers have the right to receive contracts in French — contact support@theimpulsejudge.com for a French version.</li>
      <li><strong>Other Provinces:</strong> Your provincial consumer protection legislation applies where mandatory.</li>
      <li><strong>Federal Laws:</strong> Competition Act and PIPEDA apply where applicable.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>International Consumers (EU, UK, Australia, and Others)</h4>
    <p>If you are a consumer outside Canada in a jurisdiction with mandatory consumer protection laws (including but not limited to the European Union, United Kingdom, or Australia):</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Statutory Rights Preserved:</strong> Your mandatory statutory rights under local consumer protection law (e.g., EU Directive 2019/770, UK Consumer Rights Act 2015, Australian Consumer Law) are NOT affected by these Terms</li>
      <li><strong>Arbitration May Not Apply:</strong> The arbitration clause in Section 14 may not apply to you if prohibited by your local consumer protection law — you may retain the right to bring disputes in your local courts</li>
      <li><strong>Unfair Terms:</strong> Any provision found unfair under your local law is severed or modified to comply</li>
      <li><strong>Liability Exclusions:</strong> We cannot exclude liability for death, personal injury from negligence, fraud, or other matters where exclusion is prohibited by law</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Practical Reality:</strong> Because The Impulse Judge is (a) free, (b) local-only with no data collection, and (c) not actively marketed to your region, most consumer protection remedies (refunds, price reductions, etc.) have limited practical application. However, we acknowledge and respect your statutory rights.</p>
    
    <h4>Dispute Resolution for International Consumers</h4>
    <p>If you have a consumer dispute and mandatory arbitration does not apply in your jurisdiction:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Contact Us First:</strong> Email support@theimpulsejudge.com — we will attempt to resolve issues in good faith</li>
      <li><strong>Your Local Courts:</strong> Where mandatory consumer protection laws preserve your right to local courts, that right is respected</li>
      <li><strong>EU Consumers:</strong> You may access the EU Online Dispute Resolution platform at <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr</a>, though we are not obligated to participate as a non-EU establishment</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>11. Termination</h2>
    <p>You can stop using The Impulse Judge anytime by uninstalling the extension and unsubscribing from our newsletter. We can also terminate or suspend access if you violate these terms (but honestly, if you're using an anti-impulse-buying extension maliciously, we're more confused than angry).</p>
    
    <h3>Survival After Termination</h3>
    <p>Upon termination, your right to use the Services ceases immediately. However, the following provisions survive termination indefinitely:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Intellectual Property (Section 4):</strong> Our IP rights remain protected</li>
      <li><strong>User-Generated Content License (Section 6):</strong> License grants are perpetual</li>
      <li><strong>Disclaimers (Section 9):</strong> Warranty disclaimers continue</li>
      <li><strong>Limitation of Liability (Section 10):</strong> Liability limits remain in effect</li>
      <li><strong>Project Governance (Section 12):</strong> No-obligation-to-maintain and ownership transfer provisions survive</li>
      <li><strong>Indemnification (Section 13):</strong> Your indemnification obligations continue for pre-termination conduct</li>
      <li><strong>Dispute Resolution (Section 14):</strong> Arbitration and class action waiver apply to all disputes</li>
      <li><strong>Governing Law (Section 15):</strong> Ontario law continues to govern</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>12. Project Governance & Lifecycle</h2>
    
    <h3>No Obligation to Maintain or Support</h3>
    <p>The Impulse Judge is a free, open-source project provided on a voluntary basis. <strong>We have no legal obligation to maintain, update, patch, or support the extension or website beyond what we choose to do voluntarily.</strong></p>
    <p>This means:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>We may stop development, updates, or support at any time without notice</li>
      <li>We are not required to fix bugs, respond to issues, or merge pull requests</li>
      <li>No implied warranty of continued availability or support exists</li>
      <li>Users cannot claim reliance damages if we abandon the project</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you need guaranteed support or maintenance, this is not the right tool. Consider enterprise software with SLAs instead.</p>
    
    <h3>Transfer of Ownership</h3>
    <p>We reserve the right to assign, transfer, or sell The Impulse Judge Project to a new owner (e.g., succession planning, or business transfer). If ownership changes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Binding Terms:</strong> The new owner will be bound by these Terms of Use for existing users unless and until they present new terms with reasonable notice</li>
      <li><strong>Notice of Transfer:</strong> We will make reasonable efforts to notify users of any material change in ownership through a website banner, newsletter, or extension update notice</li>
      <li><strong>No Consent Required:</strong> You acknowledge that we may transfer the project without your individual consent (but you may stop using the service if you disagree with the new owner's terms)</li>
      <li><strong>User Trust Commitment:</strong> While non-binding, we intend to only transfer ownership to parties who will respect user privacy and the project's core values. However, future owner conduct is outside our control post-transfer</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This protects user trust and any potential acquisition negotiations by setting expectations for ownership transitions.</p>
    
    <h3>Community & Contributor Relationships</h3>
    <p>The Impulse Judge is an open-source project with community contributors. <strong>Nothing in this project creates a partnership, joint venture, agency relationship, or fiduciary duty between contributors, the project owner, or users.</strong></p>
    <p>Specifically:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>GitHub organization membership does NOT create a partnership or employment relationship</li>
      <li>Contributor roles (e.g., frequent committers, issue triagers) do NOT create agency or representative authority</li>
      <li>Community moderators (Discord, Slack, Reddit, etc.) are volunteers, not employees or official representatives</li>
      <li>No fiduciary duty exists between the project and its contributors or users</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All contributors participate voluntarily under the terms of the Contributor License Agreement (CLA) and CONTRIBUTING.md. See those documents for contributor rights and responsibilities.</p>
    
    <h3>Quebec & Civil Law Jurisdictions</h3>
    <p>These Terms are governed by Ontario common law (Section 14). However, if you are a consumer in Quebec or another civil law jurisdiction with mandatory consumer protection rules:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Quebec Consumers:</strong> Nothing in these Terms limits your rights under Quebec's Consumer Protection Act or Civil Code provisions that cannot be waived by contract</li>
      <li><strong>Other Civil Law Jurisdictions:</strong> If mandatory consumer protections apply under your local law, our disclaimers and limitations apply only to the extent permitted by such laws</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We may add Quebec-specific terms or French-language translations in the future if we actively market in French Canada, but no such targeting currently exists.</p>

    <h2>13. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless The Impulse Judge Project, its creators, contributors, and affiliates from any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, or expenses (including legal fees) arising from:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your use or misuse of the extension or website</li>
      <li>Your violation of these Terms</li>
      <li>Your violation of any third-party rights</li>
      <li>Any claims that our extension caused issues with third-party websites you visited</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If a retailer's website breaks while you're using our extension, that's between you and them. You agree not to involve us in any disputes with third-party websites.</p>

    <h2>14. Dispute Resolution & Arbitration</h2>
    <p><strong>Please Read This Section Carefully - It Affects Your Legal Rights</strong></p>
    
    <h3>Geographic Scope & Consumer Protections</h3>
    <p><strong>This arbitration provision applies to users in the United States and Canada.</strong></p>
    
    <p><strong>The following consumers are EXCLUDED from mandatory arbitration and may bring claims in their local courts:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>European Union Consumers:</strong> EU consumer protection law (Directive 93/13/EEC) restricts mandatory arbitration clauses. If you are an EU resident consumer, you are NOT bound by this arbitration provision and may bring disputes in EU courts or via the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EU Online Dispute Resolution platform</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>United Kingdom Consumers:</strong> The Consumer Rights Act 2015 protects your right to take action in UK courts. If you are a UK resident consumer, the arbitration clause does NOT prevent you from bringing claims in UK courts for breach of statutory rights.</li>
      <li><strong>Australian Consumers:</strong> If Australian Consumer Law (ACL) applies to you as a consumer in Australia, you retain the right to pursue claims through Australian courts or tribunals, and this arbitration provision does not limit those rights.</li>
      <li><strong>Other Jurisdictions:</strong> If mandatory arbitration clauses are prohibited or restricted in your jurisdiction under applicable consumer protection laws, this provision is modified to comply with such laws or does not apply to you.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Arbitration Agreement (US & Canada Users)</h3>
    <p>For users in the United States and Canada (or other jurisdictions where mandatory arbitration is permitted), any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity thereof, including whether the claims asserted are arbitrable, will be determined by binding arbitration conducted under the Arbitration Act, 1991 (Ontario), rather than in court.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Individual Disputes Only:</strong> You agree to resolve disputes with us only on an individual basis. You waive any right to bring or participate in:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Class action lawsuits</li>
      <li>Class-wide arbitrations</li>
      <li>Consolidated proceedings with other users</li>
      <li>Representative actions on behalf of others</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Exceptions to Arbitration:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Small Claims Court:</strong> Either party may bring a claim in small claims court if it qualifies.</li>
      <li><strong>Injunctive Relief:</strong> Either party may seek injunctive or other equitable relief in court to prevent actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of intellectual property rights.</li>
      <li><strong>PAGA Claims:</strong> Nothing in this arbitration agreement waives your right to bring representative claims under the California Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA) where such waiver is prohibited by law.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Opt-Out Right (30 Days):</strong> You may opt out of this arbitration agreement by emailing support@theimpulsejudge.com within 30 days of first using our services with the subject line "Arbitration Opt-Out," your full name, and the date you first used the extension. If you opt out, disputes will be resolved in Ontario courts under Section 14 below.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Arbitration Procedure:</strong> If arbitration is required, it will be conducted by a single arbitrator under the Arbitration Act, 1991 (Ontario). The arbitrator's decision will be final and binding, with limited rights of appeal. The arbitration will be held in Ontario, Canada, or via remote video conference if both parties agree.</p>

    <h2>15. Governing Law & Jurisdiction</h2>
    <p>These terms shall be governed by the laws of the Province of Ontario and the laws of Canada applicable therein, without regard to conflict of law principles.</p>
    <p><strong>Exclusive Jurisdiction:</strong> Any disputes arising from these Terms (if not subject to arbitration) will be resolved exclusively in the courts of Ontario, Canada. You irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction of these courts and waive any objection to venue or claims of inconvenient forum.</p>
    <p>This means you cannot sue us in your local courts if they are outside Ontario — you must bring any legal action in Ontario courts or through the arbitration process outlined above.</p>

    <h2>16. Severability</h2>
    <p>If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms will otherwise remain in full force and effect.</p>

    <h2>17. Force Majeure</h2>
    <p>We shall not be liable for any failure or delay in performance due to circumstances beyond our reasonable control, including acts of God, war, terrorism, riots, embargoes, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods, accidents, pandemics, strikes, or shortages of transportation facilities, fuel, energy, labor, or materials.</p>

    <h2>18. Export Compliance</h2>

    </ul>

    <h2>19. Incorporation of Key Disclaimers</h2>

      <li><strong>DOM Modification Risk:</strong> The extension modifies third-party website DOM. If sites break, you agree to disable the extension as a "kill switch."</li>
      <li><strong>Not Financial/Medical Advice:</strong> The Judge is entertainment, not clinical or fiduciary advice.</li>

    <h2>22. No Waiver</h2>
