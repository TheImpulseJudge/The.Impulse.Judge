        <p class="article-intro">Standard personal finance advice is full of rules that are impossible for impulsive people to follow. The most famous one is the "30-Day Rule." It says that if you want something, you should write it down and wait 30 days. If you still want it then, you can buy it.</p>

        <p>This is great advice for neurotypical people. For people with impulse control issues or ADHD, it's useless.</p>

        <p>30 days is an eternity. You'll forget the item exists in two days. But in the moment, the urge is so screamingly loud that telling yourself "wait a month" feels like a punishment you can't endure. So you rebel and buy it now.</p>

        <h2>The 10-Minute Rule</h2>

        <p>You need a hurdle that's actually clearable. You need the <strong>10-Minute Rule</strong>.</p>

        <h3>Surfing the Urge</h3>
        <p>Neuroscience tells us that an emotional urge (like a craving for sugar or a craving to shop) is like a wave. It spikes, peaks, and then crashes. This process usually takes about 10 to 15 minutes. If you can survive the peak, the urge will fade away.</p>

        <h3>The Protocol</h3>
        <p>When you want to click "Buy," tell yourself: "I'm allowed to buy this. But I have to wait 10 minutes."</p>

        <h3>Change the Channel</h3>
        <p>You can't just sit there and stare at the screen for 10 minutes. You must close the tab or walk away from the computer. Do something physical. Wash the dishes. Do ten pushups. Walk around the block. Reset your physiology.</p>

        <h3>The Result</h3>
        <p>When you come back 10 minutes later, you'll be shocked to find that the burning "need" has turned into a mild "meh." You'll likely realize you don't care enough to open the tab again.</p>

        <div class="article-cta-box">
          <h3>🛡️ Built-In Pause Button</h3>
          <p>The Impulse Judge<sup class="tm">™</sup> forces you to pause by making you manually type out a roast before checkout. By the time you're done typing, the 10 minutes have passed and the urge has faded. It's the 10-minute rule, automated.</p>

        <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
        <p>Forget the 30-day rule. It's not built for impulsive brains. The 10-minute rule is achievable, science-backed, and actually works. All you have to do is survive the wave.</p>

        <p>And if you need help surviving it, <a href="../#install">we'll be your surfboard</a>.</p>
