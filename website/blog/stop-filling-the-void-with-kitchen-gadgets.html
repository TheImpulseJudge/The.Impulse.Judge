        <p class="article-intro">We spend a tragic amount of money buying things for our "Fantasy Self." The Fantasy Self is the version of you who is fluent in French, wakes up at 5 AM to jog, bakes organic sourdough bread, and hosts elegant dinner parties.</p>

        <p>So you buy the Rosetta Stone software. You buy the expensive running shoes. You buy the bread maker. You buy the serving platters.</p>

        <p>But the Real You is tired after work, hates running, and eats takeout on the couch.</p>

        <h2>Monuments to Failure</h2>

        <p>The result? Your house fills up with expensive monuments to your failure. Every time you open the cupboard and see the juicer you used once, you feel a pang of guilt. You bought the prop, thinking it would make you the character. But it doesn't work that way.</p>

        <h2>How to Actually Fix It</h2>

        <h3>The "Buy Backward" Rule</h3>
        <p>Never buy gear to start a hobby. Only buy gear after you have sustained the hobby. Want to start running? Run in your old sneakers for a month. If you're still running after 30 days, then go buy the nice shoes. You have to earn the upgrade.</p>

        <h3>Borrow Before Buying</h3>
        <p>You think you want to go camping? Don't go to REI and drop $500. Borrow a tent from a friend. Go camping once. You might realize you hate sleeping on the ground and hate bugs. You just saved $500.</p>

        <h3>Be Honest About Your Season of Life</h3>
        <p>You might have been a person who knitted five years ago. But are you that person now? Or do you have a toddler and a demanding job? It's okay to let go of hobbies that don't fit your current life. Stop buying supplies for a life you don't have time to live.</p>

        <div class="article-cta-box">
          <h3>🛡️ Reality Check at Checkout</h3>
          <p>When you're about to buy that bread maker for your fantasy self, The Impulse Judge<sup class="tm">™</sup> will step in and ask the hard questions. "Are you really going to bake bread? You ordered pizza three times this week." We're here to ground you in reality.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
        <p>Stop buying props for a character you're not playing. Accept who you are right now, in this season of life. If you genuinely develop a new hobby, you can buy the gear later. But buying the gear first won't make the hobby happen.</p>

        <p>And if you need help remembering that, <a href="../#install">we're happy to roast you into reality</a>.</p>
