  <article class="article-content">
    <div class="container">
      <div class="article-body">
        <p class="article-intro">There's a specific, sinking feeling that many of us know too well. It happens when you open your bank statement and see a $15 monthly charge for a streaming service you haven't watched in eight months. It happens when you throw away a bag of spinach that turned into green slime because you forgot it existed.</p>

        <p>It happens when you pay a late fee on a bill you had the money for but simply forgot to click "pay."</p>

        <p>This is the <strong>ADHD Tax</strong>.</p>

        <p>It's the financial penalty for having a brain that struggles with executive function, working memory, and dopamine regulation. It's not a sign that you're lazy, stupid, or morally failing. It's simply the cost of operating a neurodivergent brain in a world designed for neurotypical people.</p>

        <h2>Why This Happens</h2>

        <p>The ADHD brain chases the dopamine of the <em>start</em>. Buying the vegetables feels like you're already being healthy. Signing up for the free trial feels like you're getting a deal. But the maintenance (the cooking, the canceling, the scheduling) doesn't provide dopamine, so your brain ignores it.</p>

        <h2>How to Actually Fix It</h2>

        <h3>Visual Money</h3>
        <p>For people with ADHD, if you can't see it, it doesn't exist. This applies to money too. Credit cards are invisible money. Try using a prepaid debit card for your "fun spending" each month. Load it with $200. When it declines, you're done. The physical decline provides the hard stop your brain needs.</p>

        <h3>The "One Touch" Rule</h3>
        <p>This saves you from late fees and return disasters. When a bill arrives, you pay it immediately. Do not put it on the counter "for later." Later never comes. When a package arrives that you need to return, don't put it on the table. Open it, print the label, and tape it back up right now. Put it in your car immediately.</p>

        <h3>Body Doubling</h3>
        <p>If you have a pile of financial admin to do, don't try to do it alone. Ask a friend or partner to sit with you while you do it. They don't need to help. They just need to be there. The presence of another person anchors you and makes it harder for your brain to drift off.</p>

        <h3>Subscription Audit</h3>
        <p>Go through your bank statement right now. If you see a recurring charge you don't use, cancel it immediately. Do not say "I might watch that show next week." You won't. If you really want it back later, you can sign up again.</p>

        <div class="article-cta-box">
          <h3>🛡️ Automate Your Impulse Control</h3>
          <p>Your ADHD brain needs external structure. The Impulse Judge<sup class="tm">™</sup> acts as that structure by intercepting impulse purchases and forcing you to pause. It's like a body double for your checkout button.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
        <p>The ADHD Tax is real, but it's not inevitable. The key is to stop relying on your memory and start relying on systems. Automate what you can, make the invisible visible, and build external structures that do the remembering for you.</p>

        <p>And when all else fails, <a href="../#install">let us roast you</a> before you add another subscription you'll forget about.</p>
