IMPORTANT: SEPARATION OF CODE AND CONTENT

1. THE SOFTWARE: The logic, algorithms, and functional source code of this 
   extension are licensed under the MIT License (see below). You may fork,
   modify, and use this code freely.

2. THE CREATIVE ASSETS (PROPRIETARY): Our original creative expression is 
   COPYRIGHTED and NOT licensed under MIT. This includes:
   - The "Impulse Judge" name and "The Judge" persona/character
   - The specific text of all "Roasts", jokes, and comedic dialogue
   - Original visual designs and artwork we created
   - Specific game/tool names (e.g., "Dopamine Dash", "Credit Defence", "Judge The Hype", "Mystery Box of Disappointment", "Roast Roulette")
   - Original written content, website copy, and documentation humor
   
   EMOJI DISCLAIMER: We do NOT claim ownership over standard Unicode emojis 
   or third-party icon assets. Our scale icon is based on standard emoji 
   artwork and is not claimed as a proprietary trademark. We use emoji 
   artwork under the applicable vendor licenses (e.g., Microsoft Fluent UI 
   is MIT-licensed), which permits commercial use.
   
   See README.md for the complete list of proprietary creative assets.

3. WHAT WE DO NOT CLAIM: Consistent with copyright law, we make no proprietary
   claim to:
   - Our current app icon/logo (based on third-party emoji artwork)
   - Standard Unicode emojis used throughout the extension and website
   - Game mechanics, mathematical formulas, generic concepts, functional
     UI patterns, or other uncopyrightable elements
   
   You may build your own savings calculators, clicker games, swipe-judgment 
   games, or impulse-control tools using similar concepts - just create your 
   own original content.

   If you fork this repository, you MUST remove all proprietary creative 
   assets and replace them with your own. You may use the engine; you may 
   not use the personality.
