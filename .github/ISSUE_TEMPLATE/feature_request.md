**The Petition (What do you want?)**
A clear and concise description of what you want me to build. Remember: I am one developer with a caffeine addiction, not a corporation.

**The Justification (Why?)**
Is your life miserable without this? Does this feature actually save money, or is it just "nice to have"? Convince me.

**Proposed Solution**
How should it work? Do you have a design in mind? Or are you just the "ideas guy"?

**The Alternative**
What are you doing right now to solve this problem? (e.g., "Crying," "Using a spreadsheet," "Spending money blindly")

**Additional Evidence**
Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.
