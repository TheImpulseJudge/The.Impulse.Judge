## 🛒 What The Hell Is This?

You know that moment when you add something to your cart at 2 AM and your brain whispers "you deserve this"? 

Yeah. The Impulse Judge tells that voice to shut up.

This browser extension intercepts your checkout buttons on **most shopping sites**. When you try to buy something, The Judge manifests with:

- **Witty Roasts** about your financial decisions (200+ unique roasts)
- **A Pledge of Shame** you must type to proceed (no copy-paste allowed, coward)
- **Googly eyes** that follow your cursor because The Judge is always watching
- **Achievement badges** for resisting impulses (gamified fiscal responsibility)
- **Savings tracker** that shows you exactly how much money you didn't blow

It's not a blocker. It's a **speed bump for your credit card with a law degree**.

## 🔓 Why Open Source?

Because "Security by Obscurity" is for apps that have something to hide.

This extension is built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No tracking. No API calls to AI models. No data mining. No shady third-party analytics. You can audit every line of code yourself (I know you're too lazy to do that). 

Judge is not recording what you buy. Judge is not storing your credit card. Judge is not even looking at your browsing history (your search for "inflatable T-Rex costume" is between you and God).

**The Judge lives entirely in your browser.** All stats are stored locally in browser's local storage. If you uninstall it, the judgement disappears forever. Unlike your credit card debt. 

> **📜 Legal Stuff:** See the [License & IP](#-license--ip) and [Legal Disclaimer](#-legal-disclaimer) sections at the bottom for fork rules and liability details.

## 🤝 Contributing

Found a bug? Have a wittier roast? Want to add support for another retailer?

**Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) first.** Seriously. The Judge has rules.

### ⚠️ Store Policy Compliance Required

**All contributions must comply with Chrome Web Store and Firefox Add-ons content policies.** Submissions containing hate speech, harassment, discrimination, or explicit content will be **immediately rejected** and can get our extension delisted.

**Examples of acceptable vs. banned content:**
- ✅ "This $89 gadget will gather dust next to the bread maker you used once."
- ❌ "Only [demographic group] would buy this." (Instant rejection + potential ban)

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for full guidelines.

### Quick Rules:
- **Don't touch the "buy me a coffee" links.** The Judge will find you.
- **New roasts must be funny.** "Haha random" is not funny. Try again.
- **Don't refactor working code** just to make it "prettier." This is not your Notion workspace.
- **Some code was written by our LLM intern "Liability."** If it works, leave it alone.

## ☕ Fuel The Judgement

Building this took:
- Many hours of coding, testing, and bullying our intern called "Liability" (he's just an LLM that sometimes writes valid JavaScript between hallucinations, I should probably drug-test him)
- 237 cups of coffee (yes, I keep track, and I think my heart skipped a few beats)
- 1 existential crisis about my own shopping history

If this extension saved you money, **bribe the judge** so I can keep the project running and avoid selling out to ad networks (not like I have any data to sell anyway).

**Disclaimer:** This bribe does not buy you immunity. I will drink your coffee and still roast your next 3 AM purchase. Justice is blind, not cheap. The Judge cannot be bought, only fueled.

## 🚨 Legal Disclaimer

This extension uses humor and shame to discourage impulse buying. However, by installing it, you agree to the following:

- **"As Is" Software:** This extension modifies the DOM of third-party websites (Amazon, etc.). If Amazon changes their code and The Judge accidentally hides the "Buy" button forever or breaks it, **we are not liable for your inability to purchase items.**
- **The "Kill Switch":** If a site breaks, you agree to simply **disable the extension** to fix it.
- **Not Financial, Medical, or Therapeutic Advice:** The Judge is a cartoon, not a clinician or a fiduciary. Our "Free Therapy" games are for dopamine, not diagnosis. Do not take health or wealth advice from a JavaScript file.
- **Satire & Parody:** All content is satirical commentary on consumer behavior. Retailer mentions are for humorous commentary under fair use, not factual claims. We are not affiliated with any retailers mentioned.

**Full Legal Terms:** [theimpulsejudge.com/terms.html](https://theimpulsejudge.com/terms.html)

**The Judge is here to help, not harm.** If you need serious financial advice, talk to a professional. Or just... don't buy that thing.
